# C++ #

## Basics ##

### **Main Method** ###

The main method must return an integer.
Having no return statement is acceptible and non integer numbers can also be used.  

As probably expected, execution of a return statement ensures following statements will not be executed.

```cpp
int main (){
    return 0.7;
}
```

### **Printing** ###

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std; // gives us access to cout

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World! " << "Hello again " << "Goodbye!";
    
    // OR

    std::cout << "Hello, World! " << "Hello again " << "Goodbye!";
}
```

### **Enums** ###

Outputs 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main (){
    enum days {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday} yesterday, today;

days tomorrow;

std::cout << Tuesday << endl; // Output: 2
std::cout << yesterday << endl << today << endl << tomorrow; //Output: 686796 143896 117208 [on separate lines]
}
```

**Note:** `endl` is a stream manipulator object 

### **Booleans** ###

* False is 0
* True is any non-zero integer
Boolean expressions are evaluated using short-circuit evaluation. 
This means that evaluation stops as soon as the final truth value can be determined

### **Named Constants** ###
A named constant is a location in memory which we can refer to by an identifier, and in which a data value that cannot be changed is stored.

**Valid Declarations:**
```cpp
const char STAR = ‘*’ ;
const float PI = 3.14159 ;
const int MAX_SIZE = 50 ;
```

**Note:** Upper case naming convention is used for Named Constants.


### **Arrays** ###
 **In the array declaration, the dimension must be a constant expression**

```cpp
const int LENGTH = 100;
...
int a[LENGTH]
...
for (int i=0; i<LENGTH; i++)
    a[i] = 0; // initialize array
```


### **Reserved Words** ###

```cpp
bool, true, false, char, float, int, unsigned, double,
long, if, else, for, while, switch, case, break, class, 
public, private, protected, new, delete, template, 
this, virtual, try, catch, throw.
```

### **Operator Precedence** ###

**Higher**   
>`( )` Function call  
>`+`   Positive  
>`-`   Negative  
>`*`   Multiplication  
>`/`   Division  
>`%`   Modulus (remainder)  
>`+`   Addition  
>`-`   Subtraction  
>`=`   Assignment  

**Lower**

### **Logical and Relational Operators Associativity** ###

>`!` NOT Right  
>`*`, `/` , `%` Multiplication, Division, Modulus Left  
>`+` , `-` Addition, Subtraction Left  
>`<` Less than Left  
>`<=` Less than or equal to Left  
>`>` Greater than Left  
>`>=` Greater than or equal to Left  
>`==` Is equal to Left  
>`!=` Is not equal to Left  
>`&&` AND Left  
>`||` OR Left  
>`=` Assignment Right













### post and pre Increment ###

```cpp
int x =3, y=3;
cout << ++x <<endl; // Output: 4
cout << y++ <<endl; // Output: 3
```

### Ternary Operator ###
```cpp 
int x = 3, y = 4;
cout << "The max. of x and y is: " << (x>y?x:y); // Output: The max. of x and y is: 4 
```

### Methods/Functions ###

```cpp
// declares these 2 functions
int Square ( int );
int Cube ( int ) ;

int main ( void ){
    // function calls
    cout << "The square of 27 is " << Square (27) << endl ;
    cout << "The cube of 27 is " << Cube (27) << endl ;
    
    return 0 ;
}
// Method Initialisation
int Square ( int n ){return n * n ;}
// Method Initialisation
int Cube ( int n ){return n * n * n ;}
```
